- 👋 Hi, I’m @clevertrevor94
- 👀 I’m interested in data analytics and visualization, football (soccer), flavor, and body metrics
- 🌱 I’m currently continuing my learning in python, sql, r, and AWS applications
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on football analytics, food mapping, and who knows what else!
- 📫 How to reach me by email (I know, how archaic) at tlindner6@gatech.edu
